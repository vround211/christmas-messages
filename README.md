Christmas Messages
==================
The **purpose** of this project is to build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

The **objectives** are:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## The Christmas Message
The randomized output of the javascript file will be the following 3 strings:
1. A greeting from Santa which will be the same every time (Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas!)
2. A random line from the 12 days of Christmas, because Santa loves to break into song and talk about what his true love, Miss Claus, is giving him on each day leading up to Christmas
3. The verdict from the big man on whether or not you've been naughty or nice and what you're getting for Christmas
